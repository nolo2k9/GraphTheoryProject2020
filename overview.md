Introduction 
This repository contains a regular expression engine. Which is built using an algorithm called Thompsons construction. Thompsons construction is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent NFA (Nondeterministic finite automata). A regular expression is entered in or generated followed by a string to compare to the regular expression. The application then outputs a True or False statement indicating whether the entered expression and comparable string is in fact a regular expression when executed together.
I will now discuss the various files and features that are included in this application and explain how each of them work. 
home.py
The file home.py acts like a main menu or, in the context of a game or other application this would be the first screen you see upon opening the application. It acts as a guide to the user of the application on what they can do and how they can achieve the results they are looking for. The layout was developed with simplicity and ease of use in mind to allow any user to navigate the various features this application has to offer with ease and without having to feel like they have to spend a lot of time learning how to use it. 
Upon running home.py the user is faced with the following options
