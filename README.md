#**Graph Theory Project 2020**

```
The aim of this project is to build a program that can execute regular expressions on
strings using an algorithm known as Thompsonâ€™s construction.

Thompson's construction algorithm, also called the McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm, is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). This NFA can be used to match strings against the regular expression. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction)
```


##**How to use this project**
```
To run the code written in the file 'regex.py' on your console window execute the statement **python parser.py**.
parser.py runs the code written in regex.py and displays the results.
